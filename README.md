# Non-Euclidean World Editor
Computer science bachelor's final project. This Unreal Engine 5.5 project provides an interactive system for building and exploring non-Euclidean spaces in real time. Designed as a modular editor, it allows level designers to easily create and combine spatial effects such as:

- Real-time portals with accurate perspective:
  - Recursive rendering (portals within portals)
  - Scale-shifting portals (change player size)
- Local gravity zones (walk on walls and ceilings)
- Infinite corridors and staircases
- Spatial loops and impossible geometry

The goal is to offer a reusable toolset for experimenting with impossible spaces, while preserving smooth integration into standard Unreal workflows.

This project was developed as a final year thesis at the University of Granada, with a focus on gameplay experimentation, spatial design, and the technical challenges of rendering recursive and paradoxical spaces.
